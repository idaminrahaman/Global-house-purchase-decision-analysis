# 🏡 Global House Prices Analysis

This project analyzes global house purchase decisions using a dataset from Kaggle.  
Key steps include feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## 🔑 Highlights
- Added **`property_age`** (2024 - constructed_year) for better interpretability.  
- Converted property prices to **USD (`price_usd`)** using **2024 exchange rates**  
  (Bank of Finland for most currencies, Exchange-Rates.org for JPY & AED).  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,Seaborn) in Jupyter Notebook.
